# About the Knights Hardware Database and Application Project

# The code for this project was written by me as part of the course work for my Database Programming course (ITEC 4244). This was the final project for this course, and the project was designed to require us to use many of things we covered throughout the course.

# The .sql script was written by myself, and is executable in Microsoft SQL Server. The main.py program is written as a beta version of an app designed to query the Knights Hardware Database to run various CRUD operations. I have also included a .png of the database's E-R diagram.

# I received an A for this project.
